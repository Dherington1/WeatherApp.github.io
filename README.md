Weather-Dashboard:
* A simple web application that uses a third-party API that displays the weather for different cities on a dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 
in addition, this application uses localStorage to store the data of the users input and prints it out on the dashboard for the user to click on and auto load that city up.
